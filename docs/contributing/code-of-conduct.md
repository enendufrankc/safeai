# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The SafeAI project is committed to providing a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are dedicated to building a community where all participants feel safe to contribute, ask questions, and share ideas.

## Expected Behavior

All participants in SafeAI project spaces are expected to:

- **Be respectful.** Treat others as you would want to be treated. Disagreements are normal; disrespect is not.
- **Be constructive.** Offer helpful feedback. When critiquing code or ideas, focus on the work, not the person.
- **Assume good intent.** Start from the assumption that others mean well, even when communication is imperfect.
- **Be inclusive.** Use welcoming and inclusive language. Make space for new contributors and different perspectives.
- **Be professional.** Remember that this is a public project. Conduct yourself as you would in a professional setting.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated in any SafeAI project space:

- **Harassment** -- Intimidation, stalking, unwanted following, inappropriate physical or virtual contact, or sustained disruption of discussions.
- **Discrimination** -- Derogatory comments, slurs, or exclusionary behavior based on any personal characteristic.
- **Doxxing** -- Publishing others' private information (physical address, email, phone number) without explicit permission.
- **Sexual content** -- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention.
- **Trolling** -- Deliberate provocation, inflammatory comments, or bad-faith arguments.
- **Other conduct** -- Any behavior that a reasonable person would consider inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all SafeAI project spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions, code review comments)
- Communication channels (chat, forums, mailing lists)
- Project events (meetups, conferences, online gatherings)
- Any space where an individual is representing the SafeAI project

---

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers listed in `MAINTAINERS.md` in the repository root.

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (or usernames) of the people involved
- Description of the incident, including dates and locations
- Any supporting evidence (screenshots, links, logs)
- Whether you have already attempted to resolve the issue

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly. The privacy and safety of the reporter will be protected.

---

## Enforcement

Maintainers will respond to Code of Conduct violations using the following graduated approach:

### 1. Warning

A private written warning with an explanation of the violation and expected behavior change. No public action is taken.

### 2. Content Removal

Removal of the offending content (comment, PR, issue) along with a private warning. Repeated violations escalate to the next level.

### 3. Temporary Ban

Temporary removal from project spaces for a defined period. The duration depends on the severity of the violation and the individual's history.

### 4. Permanent Ban

Permanent removal from all project spaces. Reserved for severe violations or repeated patterns of unacceptable behavior.
